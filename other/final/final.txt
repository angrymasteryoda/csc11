Note: Submit the Final to my RCC email account mark.lehr@rcc.edu
with the following subject:  LastName,FirstName - Final - 48982.

Submit the solutions/program in a zipped file.

Each problem requires a c-program solution, gliffy flowchart, and it's
raspberry pi assembly program for full credit.

Flowchart the menu as well as each function problem separately.  The
c++ program can be in one file.  The solutions need to be flow charted
separately.

Do the best you can and turn in as much as you can.  

1)  Write a program that plays the game "Guess the
Number" as follows.  Your program randomly chooses the
number to be guessed by selecting an integer
at random in the range 1 to 1000.  The program
displays


I have a number between 1 and 1000
Can you guess my number?  You will be
given a maximum of 10 guesses.
Please type your first guess.


The player then types a guess.  The
program responds with one of the following.


1. Congratulations, You guessed the number!
   Would you like to play again(y or n)?
2. Too low.  Try again.
3. Too High. Try again.
4. Too many tries.


2) Write a program that fills an array then prints
the result for the following.

Input the number of years, range => 1 to 20
Input the interest rate, range   => 5% to 10%
Input the present value          => $1000 to $5000

Calculate the Future Value for year 1 to the
number of years using the following equation

FV=PV*(1+i)^n

3)  We have a quadratic equation ax^2+bx

Let x be and integer from 0 to 255
a=0.073, b=0.876

Input x,

Scale a and b as integers.  Only use integers
giving the maximum amount of accuracy.

Output the result.

4) Perform the same as 3) utilizing floats and
solve for the quadratic
