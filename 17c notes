linked list

|DATA|  --->		|DATA|
|Link|				|Link|

if i want to create a new element all i do is make a new element and link it to the address of the next one

follow the link for the order of the list

its more effiecent than an array cause you dot have to resize the array

going to need to be able to traverse the links to delete it
